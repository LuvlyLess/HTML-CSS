          <li><time datetime="4600 Ma – 4000 Ma">4600 Ma – 4000Ma</time>  <b>Hadean Eon</b>   a geologic eon of Earth history preceding the Archean. It began with the formation of the Earth about 4.6 billion years ago and ended, as defined by the International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS), 4 billion years ago. As of 2016, the ICS describes its status as "informal". The term was coined after the Greek mythical underworld Hades, by American geologist Preston Cloud, originally to label the period before the earliest-known rocks on Earth. W. Brian Harland later coined an almost synonymous term, the Priscoan Period, from priscus, the Latin word for 'ancient'. Other, older texts refer to the eon as the Pre-Archean.</li> 
		
			<li><time datetime="">4000 Ma – 2500 Ma</time> - <b> Archean Eon</b> is the second of four geologic eons of Earth's history, representing the time from 4,000 to 2,500 million years ago. In this time, the Earth's crust had cooled enough for continents to form and for the earliest known life to start. Life was simple throughout the Archean, mostly represented by shallow-water microbial mats called stromatolites, and the atmosphere lacked free oxygen. The Archean was preceded by the Hadean Eon and followed by the Proterozoic.</li>
          
          <li><time datetime="2500 Ma – 539 Ma">2500 Ma – 539 Ma</time> <b>Proterozoic Eon</b> 
          </li>         
          
          <li><time datetime="539 Ma – present">539 Ma – present</time> - <b>Phanerozoic Eon</b> is a geological eon spanning the time interval from 2500 to 538.8 million years ago.[5] It is the most recent part of the Precambrian "supereon." It is also the longest eon of the Earth's geologic time scale, and it is subdivided into three geologic eras (from oldest to youngest): the Paleoproterozoic, Mesoproterozoic, and Neoproterozoic.
          </li>
          
          <li><time datetime="From 251.9 Ma to 66 Ma">From 251.9 Ma to 66 Ma</time> - <b>Mesozoic Era</b>also called the Age of Reptiles and the Age of Conifers,[3] is the second-to-last era of Earth's geological history, lasting from about 252 to 66 million years ago and comprising the Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous Periods. It is characterized by the dominance of archosaurian reptiles, like the dinosaurs; an abundance of conifers and ferns; a hot greenhouse climate; and the tectonic break-up of Pangaea </li>
          
          <li><time datetime="66 Ma – present">66 Ma – present</time> - <b>Cenozoic Era</b> is Earth's current geological era, representing the last 66 million years of Earth's history. It is characterized by the dominance of mammals, birds and flowering plants, a cooling and drying climate, and the current configuration of continents. It is the latest of three geological eras since complex life evolved, preceded by the Mesozoic and Paleozoic.</li>

        <p><em>In biology, evolution is any change across successive generations in the heritable characteristics of biological populations. Evolutionary processes give rise to diversity at every level of biological organization, from kingdoms to species, and individual organisms and molecules, such as DNA and proteins. The similarities between all present day organisms imply a common ancestor from which all known species, living and extinct, have diverged. More than 99 percent of all species that ever lived (over five billion) are estimated to be extinct.</em></p>
